      A croissant is a buttery, crescent-shaped French pastry. Good croissants
      are light, flaky, and delicately sweet. Enjoy one with a cup of coffee —
      preferably while sitting in a charming Parisian cafe. The croissant gets
      its name from its shape: in French, the word means "crescent" or "crescent
      of the moon." The Austrian pastry known as a Kipferl is the croissant's
      ancestor—in the 1830s, an Austrian opened a Viennese bakery in Paris,
      which became extremely popular and inspired French versions of the
      Kipferi, eventually named the croissant.
